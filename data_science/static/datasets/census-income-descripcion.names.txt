| The data was split into train/test in approximately 2/3, 1/3
| proportions using MineSet's MIndUtil mineset-to-mlc.
|
| Prediction task is to determine the income level for the person
| represented by the record.  Incomes have been binned at the $50000
| level to present a binary classification problem, much like the
| original UCI/ADULT database.  The goal field of this data, however,
| was drawn from the "total person income" field rather than the
| "adjusted gross income" and may, therefore, behave differently than the
| orginal ADULT goal field (- 50000, 50000+).
